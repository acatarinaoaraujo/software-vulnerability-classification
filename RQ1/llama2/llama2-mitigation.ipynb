This suite of models, particularly the Llama 2-Chat with 7B parameters, represents a step forward in the quest for more helpful, safe, and efficient AI communication tools.\n","\n","### Architecture and Development\n","\n","Llama 2's architecture has been updated and scaled from its predecessor, Llama 1, incorporating a series of enhancements designed to improve its performance, safety, and applicability to a wide range of tasks. The architecture of Llama 2, including the 7B chat variant, features several key advancements:\n","\n","- **Pretraining on a Diverse Dataset:** Llama 2 is pretrained on a new mix of publicly available data, which has been expanded by 40% compared to the dataset used for Llama 1. This expansion allows the model to have a broader understanding of language and contexts, enhancing its versatility and capability.\n","  \n","- **Increased Context Length:** The context length, or the amount of text the model can consider at one time, has been doubled. This improvement enables Llama 2 to maintain more coherent and relevant conversations, remember more details from earlier in the dialogue, and generate more contextually appropriate responses.\n","\n","- **Grouped-Query Attention:** The model adopts the grouped-query attention mechanism, which allows it to process information more efficiently and effectively. This type of attention mechanism can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input, improving its understanding and response quality.\n","\n","- **Fine-Tuning for Dialogue:** Llama 2-Chat is specifically fine-tuned for dialogue applications, optimizing it for interactions that mimic human conversation. This fine-tuning process involves adjustments that improve the model's ability to engage in back-and-forth exchanges, understand nuances, and respond in a way that feels natural and helpful.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MWLZUD9jkSEo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Noun Group: Mitigation**\n","\n","Describes protection mechanisms that may limit the impact or actions that\n","can be taken even if the vulnerability is able to be exploited.

This trainer facilitates the training of a large language model leveraging the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach. PEFT is notable for its efficiency, targeting a subset of the model's parameters rather than its entirety, thereby conserving both computational resources and storage.
